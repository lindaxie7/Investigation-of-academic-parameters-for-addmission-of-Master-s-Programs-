# Investigation-of-academic-parameters-for-addmission-of-Master-Programs


The parameters included are :
1.	GRE Scores (out of 340)
2.	TOEFL Scores (out of 120)
3.	Undergraduate Degree University Rating (out of 5)
4.	Statement of Purpose (out of 5)
5.	Letter of Recommendation Strength (out of 5)
6.	Undergraduate GPA (out of 10)
7.	Research Experience (either 0 or 1)
8.	Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1)







Unlike other data we see from university admissions reports, this dataset includes more factors than only undergraduate GPA and standardized test scores.
Statements of purpose, letters of recommendation, and research experience are other factors outside of grades and test scores that can affect the likelihood
of admission. These factors can give admissions personnel a broader overall view of the individual student; their statement of purpose and letter of
recommendation can highlight their personality, goals, and aspirations in a way that GPA and test scores cannot. 



 



Our main goal of this project is to predict factors resulting in high chances of getting admitted into graduate programs, as this could help undergraduate
students prioritize their skill sets. 

We hypothesize: 

GRE scores and TOEFL scores have similar contributions to predicting chance of admit.


Null hypothesis: (GRE scores) =  (TOEFL Scores)

Alternative
hypothesis: (GRE scores)   (TOEFL Scores
